Higher level Rust-Lua wrapper
=============================

This project (at an early stage) aims to provide a higher-level, safe (in
the Rust sense) interface to Lua from Rust, on top of the
[rust-lua53](https://github.com/jcmoyer/rust-lua53) crate.

Suggestions/issues/questions/improvements welcome.

The initial focus is on wrapping Rust types and functions more conveniently
and safely to expose to Lua.
